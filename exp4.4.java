/*4. Write two Java classes Employee and Engineer. Engineer should inherit from
Employee class. Employee class to have two methods display() and calcSalary().
Write a program to display the engineer salary and to display from Employee class
using a single object instantiation (i.e., only one object creation is allowed).
a. display() only prints the name of the class and does not return any value. Ex. “
Name of class is Employee.”
b. calcSalary() in Employee displays “Salary of employee is 10000” and
calcSalary() in Engineer displays “Salary of employee is 20000.”*/
