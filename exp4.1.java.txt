/*1. Write a Java program which creates a class named 'Employee' having the following
members: Name, Age, Phone number, Address, Salary. It also has a method named
'print-Salary( )' which prints the salary of the Employee. Two classes 'Officer' and
'Manager' inherits the 'Employee' class. The 'Officer' and 'Manager' classes have data
members 'specialization' and 'department' respectively. Now, assign name, age, phone
number, address and salary to an officer and a manager by making an object of both
of these classes and print the same.*/
